# BipBipBop
**BipBipBop (BBB)** is a neural midi continuator plugin. 
The purpose of this project is to test the potential of different configurations of a rather simple neural architecture in a difficult task such as midi continuation.
BipBipBop is an interactive machine-assisted musical continuation tool, which allows a neural network to complete a melody provided by the user.

The project is divided into two main sections. All that concerns neural network is handled in Python, namely through the pytorch-lighting framework. Everything concerning effective midi messages collection and generation, sound synthesis and user interface is handled by the Juce framework.
