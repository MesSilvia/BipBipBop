BipBipBop (BBB) is a neural midi continuator plugin. 
The purpose of this project is to test the potential of different configurations of a rather simple neural architecture in a difficult task such as midi continuation.
BipBipBop is an interactive machine-assisted musical continuation tool, which allows a neural network to complete a melody provided by the user.
